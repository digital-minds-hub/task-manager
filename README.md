# Task Manager App

A simple, interactive task management app built with React, Material UI, and Zustand. This app lets you organize tasks in three columns: **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. You can drag and drop tasks between columns, create new tasks, and delete them as needed.

- **Drag and Drop:** Move tasks between columns using the intuitive drag-and-drop feature powered by [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).
- **Task Creation:** Easily create new tasks with a single input field.
- **Task Deletion:** Remove tasks when they're no longer needed.
- **State Management:** Using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for efficient state management.
- **Material UI Components:** A modern UI built with [Material UI](https://mui.com/).
